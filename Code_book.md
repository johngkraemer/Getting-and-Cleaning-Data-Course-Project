#Codebook (Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project)

Data gathered from 30 participants (subjects) from smartphone accelerometers and 3-axial raw signals and provided by by Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto) was loaded into R and combined (training and test data) into one data table including subject # (1-30), observed provided data (columns 2-562), and numeric “Activity” variable. Data was cleaned to remove columns which do not pertain to subject, activity, mean or std (here those which do not contain “Subject”, “mean()”, “std()”, or “Activity”). “Activity” numeric values were transformed to the character activity label applicable per activity_labels.txt. The mean for each remaining column of numeric data was then calculated based not the subset of each activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) for each subject participant number (1-6) for 180 rows of summarized data. Final tidy data is written to a tab delimited text file less row names with each participant’s (subject’s) mean value observation given each activity.
